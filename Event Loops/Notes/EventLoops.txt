In Node.js, the event loop manages multiple queues to handle different types of tasks and events efficiently. 
These queues are integral to the event-driven, non-blocking nature of Node.js. Let's explore some of the important queues in Node.js:

1.
Timer Queue: The Timer Queue handles timers scheduled using functions like setTimeout() and setInterval(). When a timer expires, 
its associated callback function is added to the event loop for execution.

2.
Promise Queue: The Promise Queue handles the execution of resolved or rejected promises. When a promise is resolved or rejected, 
its corresponding then() or catch() callbacks are added to the Promise Queue.

3.
NextTick Queue: The NextTick Queue is a special queue that has a higher priority than other queues. Functions scheduled using 
process.nextTick() are added to this queue. They are executed immediately after the current operation completes, before any other 
queued operations.

4.
I/O Queue: The I/O Queue handles I/O-related callbacks, such as those associated with file system operations, network requests, and 
other asynchronous I/O tasks.

5.
Close Queue: The Close Queue handles the callbacks associated with closing events, like when a socket or server is closed. These 
callbacks are executed after the event loop finishes processing all the other queues.

6.
Microtask Queue (also known as Job Queue): This queue handles microtasks, such as promises and 
certain API callbacks (e.g., process.nextTick() and queueMicrotask()). Microtasks are executed after each phase of the event loop, 
ensuring that promises and other microtasks are resolved before the event loop moves on to the next cycle.



The event loop follows a specific order of processing these queues in each iteration. It first processes the Timer Queue, 
then moves on to the I/O Queue, then the Microtask Queue, and finally the Close Queue.

It's essential to understand the order of processing and the behavior of each queue to write efficient and predictable asynchronous 
code in Node.js. This event loop mechanism ensures that long-running or blocking tasks do not hinder the execution of other operations 
and keeps the application responsive and performant.
