Streams in the fs module are instances of EventEmitter and are used to handle data flow between input and output in a chunked manner. 
They allow you to work with data in small pieces, reducing memory usage and enabling more efficient processing of large files.


There are four types of streams in Node.js:

1.
Readable Streams: These streams are used for reading data from a source, such as a file or network connection. 
They emit 'data' events as chunks of data become available. Examples of readable streams include fs.createReadStream() and http. 
IncomingMessage.

2.
Writable Streams: These streams are used for writing data to a destination, such as a file or network connection. 
You can use them to send data in smaller chunks, making it suitable for large files. Examples of writable streams include 
fs.createWriteStream() and http.ServerResponse.

3.
Duplex Streams: Duplex streams are both readable and writable. They allow data to flow in both directions. 
Examples include net.Socket and tls.TLSSocket.

4.
Transform Streams: Transform streams are a type of duplex stream that allows you to modify or transform data while it's being read or 
written. Examples include zlib.createGzip() and crypto.createCipher().


Here's an example of using readable and writable streams to copy the contents of one file to another:

const fs = require('fs');

const sourceFilePath = 'path/to/source/file.txt';
const destinationFilePath = 'path/to/destination/file.txt';

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream(sourceFilePath);
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream(destinationFilePath);

readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  writableStream.write(chunk);
});

readableStream.on('end', () => {
  writableStream.end();
});


In this example, we use fs.createReadStream() to create a readable stream that reads data from sourceFilePath, and 
fs.createWriteStream() to create a writable stream that writes data to destinationFilePath. We then listen for the 'data' event on the 
readable stream to receive chunks of data and write them to the writable stream.

Keep in mind that using streams is particularly beneficial for handling large files or working with data asynchronously, as it allows 
you to process data in smaller chunks, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.
