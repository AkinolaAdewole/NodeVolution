npm stands for "Node Package Manager." It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language and is primarily used to manage
software dependencies and packages in Node.js projects. npm allows developers to easily install, update, and remove packages from their 
projects and provides a vast collection of open-source libraries and tools that can be utilized to extend the functionality of their 
applications.

With npm, developers can specify the dependencies required for their projects in a configuration file called "package.json." 
This file contains information about the project, including its name, version, description, author, and, most importantly, a list of 
dependencies with their specific version requirements. When a developer initiates an npm installation, the package manager reads the 
package.json file and downloads and installs all the specified dependencies recursively.

Some common npm commands include:

npm install: Installs all the dependencies specified in the package.json file.
npm install <package-name>: Installs a specific package and adds it to the dependencies list in the package.json file.
npm update: Updates all the packages to their latest compatible versions based on the version requirements specified in the 
package.json file.

npm uninstall <package-name>: Uninstalls a specific package and removes it from the dependencies list in the package.json file.
npm init: Initializes a new Node.js project and generates a package.json file interactively, allowing you to set various 
project-related configurations.

npm search <keyword>: Searches the npm registry for packages that match the provided keyword.

npm run <script-name>: Executes a custom script defined in the package.json file, useful for running tasks like building, testing, or 
starting the application.


npm plays a crucial role in the JavaScript ecosystem, making it easy for developers to manage dependencies and collaborate on projects, 
ultimately contributing to the growth and robustness of the Node.js and JavaScript development community.
