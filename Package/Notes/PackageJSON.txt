The package.json file is a configuration file used in Node.js projects to define various aspects of the project, 
including its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other metadata. It is a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file that resides in
 the root directory of a Node.js project.

Here is an example of a basic package.json file:

{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My Node.js project",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.12",
    "eslint": "^7.32.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js",
    "lint": "eslint ."
  }
}
