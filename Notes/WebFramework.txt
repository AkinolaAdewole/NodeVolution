Node.js has several popular web frameworks that simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. 
These frameworks provide a structured and organized approach to handle routing, middleware, and request/response handling. 
Some of the most popular web frameworks in Node.js include:

1.
Express.js: Express.js is the most widely used and mature web framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalist, flexible, and robust set 
of features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js supports middleware, routing, templating engines, and a variety of other 
functionalities, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers.

2.
Koa.js: Koa.js is developed by the same team behind Express.js and aims to provide a more modern and lightweight framework. It utilizes 
ES6 syntax and async/await for cleaner code and better error handling. While it is less opinionated than Express.js, it offers a 
powerful set of middleware capabilities.

3.
Hapi.js: Hapi.js is a powerful and feature-rich framework designed for building scalable and modular applications. 
It emphasizes configuration-driven development, making it an excellent choice for large and complex projects. Hapi.js also includes a 
plugin system that allows developers to easily extend its functionality.

4.
Nest.js: Nest.js is a progressive, TypeScript-based framework that combines elements of object-oriented programming, functional 
programming, and reactive programming. It is built with an opinionated architecture and helps developers create highly modular and 
scalable applications.

5.
Sails.js: Sails.js is a full-featured MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework that follows the convention over configuration principle. 
It comes with built-in support for real-time features and is suitable for building data-driven applications like APIs and chat 
applications.

6.
Meteor.js: Meteor.js is a full-stack framework that allows developers to build web and mobile applications with real-time updates. 
It includes a built-in front-end library and a reactive data layer, making it easier to build interactive applications.

Each of these frameworks has its own strengths and use cases, so the choice depends on the specific requirements and preferences of the 
project. Express.js remains the most popular choice due to its simplicity, extensive community support, and a vast ecosystem of 
middleware and plugins. However, other frameworks like Koa.js, Hapi.js, Nest.js, Sails.js, and Meteor.js offer unique features and 
advantages that might be a better fit for certain projects.
