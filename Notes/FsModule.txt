The fs (File System) module in Node.js is a built-in module that provides an interface for interacting with the file system. 
It allows you to work with files, directories, and file-related operations such as reading, writing, updating, and deleting files. 
The fs module provides both synchronous and asynchronous methods for file operations, but it is generally recommended to use the 
asynchronous methods to avoid blocking the event loop in Node.js.

To use the fs module, you need to require it in your Node.js application:

const fs = require('fs');


Here are some common functions provided by the fs module:

2.
Reading Files:
fs.readFile(path[, options], callback): Asynchronously reads the entire contents of a file.
fs.readFileSync(path[, options]): Synchronously reads the entire contents of a file.

Example of reading a file asynchronously:

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File content:', data);
  }
});

3.
Writing Files:
fs.writeFile(file, data[, options], callback): Asynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists.
fs.writeFileSync(file, data[, options]): Synchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists.

Example of writing to a file asynchronously:

const content = 'Hello, this is some text data.';
fs.writeFile('file.txt', content, 'utf8', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File has been written successfully.');
  }
});


4.
Working with Directories:
fs.mkdir(path[, options], callback): Asynchronously creates a new directory.
fs.mkdirSync(path[, options]): Synchronously creates a new directory.
fs.readdir(path[, options], callback): Asynchronously reads the contents of a directory.
fs.readdirSync(path[, options]): Synchronously reads the contents of a directory.

Example of creating a directory:

fs.mkdir('myDirectory', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error creating directory:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Directory created successfully.');
  }
});


These are just a few examples of the many functions provided by the fs module in Node.js. The fs module is powerful and versatile, 
enabling you to perform a wide range of file system-related tasks and operations. Remember to use the asynchronous versions of these 
functions whenever possible to maintain the non-blocking nature of Node.js and prevent the event loop from being blocked.
