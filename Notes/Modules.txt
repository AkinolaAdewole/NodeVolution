In Node.js, modules are a fundamental concept used to organize and structure code into reusable units. 
A module is simply a file containing JavaScript code that defines functions, classes, or variables that can be imported and 
used in other parts of the application. This modularity allows developers to break down large applications into smaller, 
manageable pieces, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.


1.
Core Modules: These are built-in modules that come bundled with Node.js and are part of its standard library. 
Examples of core modules include fs (File System), http (HTTP server and client), path (path manipulation utilities), and 
util (utility functions). Core modules can be accessed without the need for installation or additional configuration.

To use a core module, you need to require it in your code like this:

const fs = require('fs');



2.
Local Modules: These are user-defined modules that developers create to encapsulate specific functionalities. 
Local modules are typically stored in separate files and can be imported into other files using the require() function.
Example of a local module:

// File: utils.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

module.exports = { add, subtract };

To use the above module in another file:

// File: app.js
const { add, subtract } = require('./utils');

console.log(add(5, 3));       // Output: 8
console.log(subtract(10, 5)); // Output: 5



In this example, we created a local module in utils.js, 
which exports two functions, add and subtract. In app.js, we import those functions using require('./utils').

It's important to note that starting from Node.js version 14, you can also use ECMAScript modules (ESM) with the .mjs file extension. 
In ESM, you use import and export statements, similar to modern JavaScript in the browser. 
To use ESM, you need to set the "type": "module" in your package.json file or use the .mjs extension.

However, the CommonJS module system is still widely used and considered the default for most Node.js applications, 
especially for older codebases and packages available on npm.
