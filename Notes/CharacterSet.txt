In Node.js, a character set refers to a specific collection of characters that can be used in a string or text. 
Character sets are essential when working with strings, as they define which characters are valid and can be used in various 
operations like searching, replacing, or validating input data.

Node.js, like JavaScript in general, uses the Unicode character set, which is a standard for character encoding and includes a vast 
range of characters from various languages, symbols, emojis, and special characters.

JavaScript strings are UTF-16 encoded, meaning they can represent any character in the Unicode character set. This makes it possible to 
work with text in multiple languages and handle a wide range of characters.

Here's an example of using a Unicode character in Node.js:

const heart = '\u2665';
console.log(heart); // Output: ♥


In this example, we use the Unicode escape sequence (\u2665) to represent the heart symbol (♥).

Node.js provides various string methods to work with characters and character sets, such as charAt(), charCodeAt(), and normalize().
Additionally, regular expressions in JavaScript can be used to match specific character patterns and perform various text-related 
operations.

It's essential to be aware of character encoding when working with strings in Node.js, especially when dealing with input/output 
operations, data persistence (e.g., databases and files), and network communication. Properly handling character encoding can prevent 
issues related to data corruption and ensure consistent and accurate text processing across different environments and platforms.
