In Node.js, you can create custom classes that extend the built-in EventEmitter class from the events module. By doing so, 
you can make your custom classes emit events and allow other parts of your application to listen for and respond to those events.

To extend the EventEmitter class, you need to use JavaScript's inheritance mechanism, which allows your custom class to inherit the 
methods and properties of the EventEmitter.

Here's an example of how to extend from EventEmitter in Node.js:



const EventEmitter = require('events');

class MyCustomEmitter extends EventEmitter {
  constructor() {
    super(); // Call the constructor of the EventEmitter class
  }

  performTask(task) {
    // Perform some task...

    // Emit an event with the result of the task
    this.emit('taskCompleted', `Task '${task}' is completed.`);
  }
}

// Create an instance of the custom emitter
const myEmitter = new MyCustomEmitter();

// Register an event listener for the 'taskCompleted' event
myEmitter.on('taskCompleted', (message) => {
  console.log(message);
});

// Perform the task using the custom emitter
myEmitter.performTask('Do the dishes');


Output:
Task 'Do the dishes' is completed.



In this example, we create a custom class MyCustomEmitter that extends from EventEmitter. 
The MyCustomEmitter class has a method performTask() that simulates performing some task and then emits a 'taskCompleted' event with 
a message as the event data.

When we create an instance of MyCustomEmitter (myEmitter), we can use its methods, including the performTask() method, and 
we can also register event listeners for its custom events using the .on() method.

By extending from EventEmitter, you can create more complex and event-driven components in your Node.js applications. 
This pattern is especially useful for building 
scalable and modular systems where different parts of the application can communicate and respond to events without tight coupling.
