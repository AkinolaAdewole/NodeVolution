In Node.js, pipes are a powerful mechanism provided by streams to simplify the handling of data flow between readable and writable 
streams. They allow you to connect the output of one stream as the input of another, creating a seamless data transfer process.

The pipe() method is used to establish a pipe between two streams. It takes a single argument, which is the destination writable stream. 
When you call pipe() on a readable stream, it connects the data events of the readable stream to the writable stream, automatically 
handling data flow for you.

The syntax for using the pipe() method is as follows:

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

Here's an example of using pipes to copy the contents of one file to another:

const fs = require('fs');

const sourceFilePath = 'path/to/source/file.txt';
const destinationFilePath = 'path/to/destination/file.txt';

const readableStream = fs.createReadStream(sourceFilePath);
const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream(destinationFilePath);

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);

readableStream.on('end', () => {
  console.log('File copy complete.');
});

In this example, we create a readable stream using fs.createReadStream() to read data from sourceFilePath, and a writable stream using 
fs.createWriteStream() to write data to destinationFilePath. We then use the pipe() method to connect the two streams.

The pipe() method automatically handles the data transfer from the readable stream to the writable stream, ensuring that the data is 
efficiently and safely transmitted in chunks, which is particularly useful for large files. When the readable stream reaches 
its end (all data has been transferred), it emits the 'end' event, allowing you to perform any necessary cleanup or additional tasks.

Pipes provide a more concise and efficient way to work with streams and are especially useful when you need to perform simple data 
transformations, copying files, or passing data between various streams in Node.js applications.
