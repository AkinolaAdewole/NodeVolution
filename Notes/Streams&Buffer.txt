Streams and Buffers are important concepts in Node.js that are used to efficiently handle and manipulate data, especially when dealing 
with large datasets or when working with binary data.

Streams:
Streams are a way to handle reading from and writing to data sources or destinations in Node.js in a more efficient and memory-friendly 
manner. Streams allow you to process data piece by piece (chunk) instead of loading the entire data into memory at once. 
This is particularly useful when dealing with large files or network data.
Node.js provides four types of streams:

Readable: Used for reading data from a source (e.g., files, HTTP responses).
Writable: Used for writing data to a destination (e.g., files, HTTP requests).
Duplex: Streams that are both readable and writable.
Transform: Special type of duplex stream that allows data to be modified while it is being read or written.


Example of using a Readable stream to read data from a file:
