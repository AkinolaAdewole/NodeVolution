In Node.js, encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format to another. It is commonly used when reading from or 
writing to streams, files, or buffers. There are various encoding formats available in Node.js, and each serves a specific purpose. 
Here are some commonly used encodings in Node.js:

UTF-8: UTF-8 is the default encoding for text data in Node.js. It is a variable-width encoding that can represent all Unicode characters. 
When working with text data, UTF-8 is typically the encoding you should use.

ASCII: ASCII encoding represents only the first 128 ASCII characters (0 to 127) using a single byte for each character.

Base64: Base64 encoding is used to convert binary data to a text format, mainly when dealing with binary files or data that cannot be 
directly represented in a text format.

Binary: Binary encoding allows you to read or write raw binary data without any conversion.

When reading from or writing to files or streams in Node.js, you can specify the desired encoding as the second argument to the 
relevant methods.


Example of reading a file using UTF-8 encoding:

const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File content (UTF-8):', data);
  }
});

Example of reading a file using Base64 encoding:

const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('image.png', 'base64', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File content (Base64):', data);
  }
});


When writing to files or streams, you can also specify the desired encoding in the fs.writeFile() or fs.createWriteStream() methods.

Example of writing to a file using UTF-8 encoding:

const fs = require('fs');

const content = 'Hello, this is some text data.';
fs.writeFile('file.txt', content, 'utf-8', (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error writing file:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('File has been written successfully.');
  }
});


These are just a few examples of how encoding is used in Node.js. Depending on the specific use case, you might encounter other 
encodings or need to use additional encoding-related methods in Node.js. Always ensure you are using the appropriate encoding for 
your data to prevent unexpected behavior or data corruption.
